# OpenGL Template for MacOS (Terminal)

because it's a pain to setup anything for c/c++

This template will render a black screen with blue rectangle on it. I will highly recommend [this](https://cse.engineering.nyu.edu/cs653/OpenGLCompilationMacLinux8.pdf) guide by the NYU for it.

# Steps to compile

1. Clone this repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/nibodhdaware/opengl-template.git`
2. Open the Terminal at the folder
3. Create a build folder using `mkdir build`
4. `cd` into the build folder
5. Run `cmake ..` to build the project
6. Run `./Example` or the name of your main file to execute the program.
